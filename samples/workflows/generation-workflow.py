"""Agent Workflow - Content Review with Quality Routing.

This sample demonstrates:
- Using agents directly as executors
- Conditional routing based on structured outputs
- Quality-based workflow paths with convergence

Use case: Content creation with automated review.
Writer creates content, Reviewer evaluates quality:
  - High quality (score >= 80): → Publisher → Summarizer
  - Low quality (score < 80): → Editor → Publisher → Summarizer
Both paths converge at Summarizer for final report.
